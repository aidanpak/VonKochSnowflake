# VonKochSnowflake
This project integrates mathematics into programming. The Von Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that can be built up iteratively. 

Starting as a single equilateral triangle.. each iteration will replace every line with another equilateral triangle. The 'level' variable can be changed to showcase the different sequences of the curve. To witness the different levels just alter the call of the VonKoch function..
